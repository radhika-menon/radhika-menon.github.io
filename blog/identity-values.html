        <h2>My identity, strengths and values</h2>

        <p class="question">
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
        <p>
            I am from Kerala in India, and my identity has been shaped by my upbringing. Coming from a collectivist
            culture,
            who I am today is a culmination of all the values I have learnt and the
            support I have received from my whānau, teachers and friends. Strong family values, respect for elders and a
            sense of duty towards my whānau, are some of the values my culture has imbibed in me.
        </p>

        <p class="question">Describe your core personal values.</p>
        <p>
            The values I uphold are living with integrity, being in harmony with other people and the environment, and
            giving back to the society.

        </p>

        <p class="question">Describe your strengths and limitations.</p>
        <p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Strengths</th>
                <td>Kindness, Respect, Empathy, Resilience, Positive attitude</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Limitations</th>
                <td>Can overload myself and not reach out for help, trying to do things as properly or perfectly as
                    possible, managing conflicts</td>
            </tr>

        </table>
        In the Myers Briggs personality test, I am a Defender ISFJ-T. As per their evaluation, my strengths include
        being helpful, empathatic, reliable and loyal. The limitations include setting too high standards for oneself,
        tendency to overload and repressing feelings.
        </p>

        <!--Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
        involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.-->

        <p class="question">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
            learning obstacles.</p>
        <p>My strengths make me a kind and empathetic team player. I am a listener and I respect other people's
            viewpoints. My resilience allows me to see things through to
            completion inspite of difficulties, which will be particularly advantageous during the bootcamp. With
            respect to my limitations, as I am
            aware of them, I shall take conscious measures to ask for help. I also understand the very essence
            of Agile methodology is to create and refine your product, so I will stick to the timeboxes and move on to
            the next exercise even if I feel my output isn't as good as I want it to be.</p>

        <!--Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
            reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.-->
