        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            In this post, I discuss what neuroplasticity and growth mindset are, and how they relate to my learning
            journey at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            How do people benefit from understanding the principles of neuroplasticity?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Neuroplasticity</em></strong> refers to the brain's ability to change structurally and
            functionally in response to
            various experiences throughout our lives. Everytime we learn something new or undergo a new experience,
            the neurons in our brain form new or stronger connections with one another. This enables us to
            adapt to different experiences, such as rehabilitation after an injury.
        </p>
        <p>
            A great starting point to understand neuroplasticity is by listening to <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHBMFCzznE" target="_blank">Dr Lara Boyd's TEDx
                Talk</a>. She explains that long-term memory occurs when new connections are formed between neurons,
            thus changing the structure of the brain. But these connections can be formed only through long-term
            repetitive experiences or actions of a certain intensity. The more we practice the stronger the neural
            connections become until we
            do an action or behave in
            a certain way automatically. Now we know why <strong><em>"practice makes perfect"</em></strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            When we understand that our brain is changeable, we develop a <strong><em>growth mindset</em></strong>,
            which motivates us to learn a new skill, break
            a habit, or modify our behaviour through regular practice. This is in contrast to
            having a fixed mindset where one believes they have been born with a static set of traits, including
            character and intelligence. They attribute their achievements to these qualities and therefore, view failure
            as a deficiency of own's abilities. This makes them feel the need to continuously prove themselves
            to show their abilities are good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diagram below clearly summarises the key differences between people with fixed and
            growth mindsets in the context of achievements.

        <p class="question">
            What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sleep:</strong> Perhaps the most important is sleep! Regular adequate sleep is necessary to
                strengthen important neural connections and weaken irrelevant ones, as revealed in this

                the University of Cambridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Focus:</strong> Paying attention makes you an effective learner according to 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfgpHWPlYo4" "target = " _blank">Dr Michael Merzenich</a>.
                This ties in well with the concept of <strong><em>mindfulness</em></strong>, which we have been
                practising at Dev Academy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise stimulates the growth of brain cells and neuronal
                connections (from <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-exercise-affects-your-brain/"
                    target="_blank">scientificamerican</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="question">
            How is growth mindset relevant?
        </p>
        <p> This lovely animation for children summarises how a
            growth mindset can help you achieve things in life. The lessons learnt are relevant not only to learning but
            for all aspects of our lives.

        </ul>
        <p>
            When applying our growth mindset to learning, it is important to understand that neuroplasticity is variable
            between people, i.e., the amount of practice required can vary between people striving to master the
            the same activity. So one must not compare one's learning with others. For
            instance, when learning to drive a car for the first time, one person could master the skills with 50 hours
            of driving practice, while someone else would require 200 hours.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            How would you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?
        </p>
        <p>
            As I now understand the principles of neuroplasticity and how to enhance it, I can apply them to my
            learning at Dev Academy and in other aspects of my life. In the case of web development, I will ensure I
            build my technical competence through daily practice of adequate dosage, while being a mindful learning.
            I normally pay attention to getting adequate sleep and exercise, and will continue to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? In this exploration, did anything change
            you?
        </p>
        <p>The lessons I have learnt from my research on neuroplasticity and growth mindset have certainly made my
            attitude towards learning more positive. In particular, I will remember the power of "yet". If I fail to
            find the solution to a task, I must not be dejected or feel dumb. Instead, I can use problem solving
            techniques to review my work, and reach out for help to find a solution. Clearly, learning and
            practising through challenging tasks are the stepping stones to success.
