    <h2>Reflection on Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      Five weeks of Foundations have now passed. During this time, I explored several topics included in the core skills
      curriculum, which I shared in my cultural blog. I now pause and reflect on all that I have learned.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I realised that I feel terrible when I make mistakes because I think I could lose other’s impression of me or
        their approval. That’s how people with fixed mindsets think. After learning about growth mindset in the core
        curriculum, I now know that what would matter more to someone else is how I
        communicate my mistake, take responsibility and rectify it, and learn from it. Humans make mistakes after all.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, I have always had the “I can do it” aspect of the growth mindset, because of which I have tried hard
        and achievd many things.
      </li>
      <li>
        I learnt that there are several aspects of my EQ that I can work on, such as dealing with conflicts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="question">
      What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </p>
    <p>
      I need to be conscious about my values to know what I want to learn and where I want to apply it. Self-awareness
      of my mental and physical well-being is paramount to staying healthy, motivated and happy when spending so many
      hours
      learning and programming. Also, being able to work as a team is crucial to being a great programmer. This includes
      communicating ideas and discussing different viewpoints in an empathetic manner.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised by how much more there is to being a good software developer than the technical skills. The
      importance
      of being an empathetic person to work with and learning to work with others was highlighted through the core
      topics on
      EQ.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the core learnings and applying them practically has been most challenging. For instance, I am making a
      conscious effort to listen attentively everytime I have a conversation and being mindful of my actions. They are
      easier said than done!
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
      development bootcamp course?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>So people can be self aware of their mental and physical health, particularly when working long hours in a
        bootcamp.</li>
      <li>Practising mindfulness, improving your EQ and adopting a growth mindset can reduce stress and enhance your
        motivation as well as productivity.</li>
      <li>To be an empathetic team player.</li>
      <li>To embrace challenges positively and without getting stressed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="question">
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time
      to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am someone who doesn’t articulate my emotions and thoughts about my values – so I had to get out of my comfort
      zone to write the cultural blogs. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the core topics. Learning their principles
      gave immense positivity and the confidence that I can improve my core skills. Therefore, I do not believe it was a
      waste of time, although I would have been happier not having to pen them down as much.
