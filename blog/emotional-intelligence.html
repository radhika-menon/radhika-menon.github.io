        <p class="question">
            What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence refers to how a person identifies and controls one's own emotions, as well as how
            they perceive the emotions of other people. It is measured numerically and represented as the EQ or
            emotional quotient.

        </p>

        <p class="question">How is it different to IQ?</p>
        <p>
            IQ or Intelligence Quotient is a numerical score that measures a person's intellectual abilities such as
            memory, quantitative reasoning, visual and spatial processing etc. A person with a high IQ can work out the
            solution for a difficult mathematics problem, for instance. But that person may not necessarily have a high
            EQ.</p>

        <p class="question">Why is it important?</p>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is important because it determines how a person relates to others. In other words how
            does one use their emotions for social communication and modulate those emotions based on those of others
            around them. In a workplace scenario, the dynamics of a team depends on each member's emotional
            intelligence. Every member must be able to look within themselves and identify if they are stressed so that
            measures can be taken to counter that, such as reducing workload by delegating tasks to others. They must
            also be able to engage with their teammates in an open, respectful and empathetic manner even when dealing with
            conflicting viewpoints.
