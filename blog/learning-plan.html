        <p>
            I want to be a software developer, working on products that contribute towards enhancing people's well-being
            and safety. I also want to develop my career and human skills in such a manner, that I can inspire the
            younger generation for a career in STEM.

            want to be more confident about asking questions and voicing my opinions.</p>

        <p>
            I am committed to my learning journey at Dev Academy and will complete each sprint on time. I have a
            supportive family, so although I have commitments, I shall be able to dedicate the required hours each
            week. I have school pick-up and drop-off commitments in Sprint 3.
