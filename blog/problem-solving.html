    <p class="question">
      Getting blocked on a simple problem
    </p>
    <p>
      While doing the Kata on JS Olympics, I got blocked in the function to unjumble the words. I used the
      <strong>split</strong> built-in method to break down the incoming string. But I broke it down to an
      array of words using <strong>str.split(' ')</strong>. I then had to loop over each word in the array and reverse
      them individually. I frequently used console logging to understand what was happening to my arrays and strings. I
      felt slightly frustrated at spending too much time on this task.
      Finally, I managed to produce a working function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when I finished the whole exercise and reviewed the sample
      solutions, I found that I could have easily used <strong>str.split('')</strong> (without space between the quotes)
      to break down the string into an array
      of individual characters. I learnt from this experience to be mindful when reading the documentation.

    <p class="question">
      Solving a problem in an elegant way
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I solved the super_fizzbuzz challenge elegantly because I systematically thought through the problem
      and produced a straightforward solution. On comparing it with the sample solution, I knew I had devised the same strategy and the code was clean.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Pseudocode, rubber ducky method
    </p>
    <p>
      I tend to mentally plan at least half the solution before I get started, which I think equates to thinking in
      pseudocode. I also often have a conversation with myself if I get stuck. I ask, "ok, so what did we do?". The
      voice asking the question is my present self and it is aimed at my past self, who can be considered as the rubber
      ducky. The two of us can work together to solve the problem. (Haha, now you know I love the time travel theme!)
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      Reading error messages, console logging, googling
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an avid user of console logging to understand how my variables are being modified. I used it even before I
      come across an error. I believe coding in this "debug" mode keeps me in control. When I come across an error, I
      often google it up if I can't understand it. In all other cases, I check MDN first, or google away to find
      information. I have also found the sample tests in W3Schools useful to understand how functions behave by
      modifying them and seeing the results.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Asking for help
    </p>
    <p>
      I have reached out for help to my facilitator to clarify my understanding of some concepts. I have also engaged
      with my colleagues through Slack to share resources I found helpful and to clarify a concept one of them commented
      on.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Improving your process with reflection
    </p>
    <p>
      Having explored the principles of mindfulness, emotional intelligence and growth mindset, I find that I am making
      a conscious effort to reflect on my process of problem solving. This is in addition to inherently learning from my
      coding mistakes or
      through research on various topics conducted during the sprints.
