        <h2>Javascript and the DOM</h2>

        <p class="question">Describe the differences between HTML and CSS using an analogy</p>
        <p>A web page is essentially a document. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language you use to provide
            your content, structured in a particular
            manner, on a web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the technology that
            enables you to format all that content and present it as a visually appealing product. Let's use the analogy
            of a dessert. </p>
        <p>If you only had a HTML document with no styling by CSS, you would know the dessert comprises
            of 30g vanilla ice cream, 10g chocolate ganache and 15g raspberries, and it would be dished up on a white
            plate with each item placed one below the other. </p>
        <p>Now consider plating your dessert creatively. Perhaps you
            could use a stoneware blue plate, place 10 dots of ganache to form a circular border and within that arrange
            the raspberries in a spiral form. Finally, finish off with the dollop of ice cream in the centre of the
            plate.
            These details which enhance the
            beauty of your dessert are what would be specified in your CSS file.</p>
        <p class="question">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</p>
        <p>Say you want to put on your jacket. This activity is a process and has a series of sub-tasks. Control flow
            is the order in which you are going to perform this activity, and is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Lift jacket up by the collar with your left hand.</li>
            <li>Insert right arm into the right sleeve.</li>
            <li>Grasp collar with right hand.</li>
            <li>Release left hand from collar.</li>
            <li>Insert left arm into left sleeve.</li>
            <li><strong><em>If jacket has a zip</em></strong>, then go to sub-task #7, <strong><em>else if jacket has
                        buttons</em></strong>, then go directly to sub-task #8.</li>
            <li>Do the following for zipping up a jacket:
                <ol class="small-roman">
                    <li>...</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>For each button</em></strong>, do the following:
                <ol class="small-roman">
                    <li>...</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>


        The computer is instructed to perform an activity in a similar manner. It is given a series of instructions,
        i.e., the code, and it executes each line in the code sequentially, unless it comes across certain coniditions.
        For instance, if it encounters an <strong>if-else condition<em></em></strong>, such as the case of the jacket
        having a zip or buttons, it would skip over some code and execute only the required lines.
        </p>
        <p>Another scenario is a loop, i.e., there may be sub-tasks which have to be repeated until some condition is
            met. In our example above, you are provided a set of steps to fasten a button and these steps must be
            repeated until every button has been fastened. A <strong><em>for loop</em></strong> has been used in this
            case. </p>
        <p class="question">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</p>
        <p>The DOM stands for Document Object model and is the interface for programming languages to interact and
            manipulate a web page. Here, we consider we have an HTML document and want to use Javascript as the
            programming language to change the document's content, structure and style dynamically.</p>
        <p> The DOM represents the HTML document as a hierarchy of objects. Therefore, the properties and methods of the
            objects can be accessed and modified using pre-defined functions called APIs.</p>
        <p>For instance, the whole HTML document is represented by an object called <strong>document</strong> which has
            a method called <strong>getElementsByClassName</strong>. If the name of a class is provided as input to this
            API, it will output all the child elements of the <strong>document</strong> object which belong to that class. If the class name is "blue", we can call:</p>
            <p><strong>var blueElements = document.getElementsByClassName('blue')</strong></p>
        <p class="question">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</p>
        <p>
        <h4><em>Arrays</em></h4>The items in an array are indexed and square brackets can be used to access each element
        using
        the format
        <strong>arrayName[index]</strong>. It must be noted that array indexing starts at 0.</p>
        <p>For example, consider an array named studentScores containing the scores received by 5 students for a
            course.</p>
        <p><strong>var studentScores = [80, 76, 54, 68, 86] </strong></p>
        <p>The first and third students' scores are 80 and 54, respectively, and can be accessed using indices 0 and
            2, as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>var firstStudentScore = studentScores[0]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>var thirdStudentScore = studentScores[2]</strong></p>
        <h4><em>Objects</em></h4>
        <p>An object is created with a set of properties in a key-value format. Consider an object called course1 with
            two properties, courseID and finalScores. </p>
        <p><strong>var course1 = {courseID: "ABC2021", finalScores: studentScores}</strong></p>
        <em>courseID</em> and <em>finalScores</em> are the keys, and their corresponding values are <em>ABC2021</em> and
        the array we created earlier,
        <em>studentScores</em>, respectively. Using <strong>objectName.key</strong>, you can retrieve the values
        associated with those keys.</p>
        <p>For example, <strong>course1.finalScores</strong> will return the array of scores [80, 76, 54, 68, 86] as the
            output.
            To directly access the 4th student's score from the course1 object, you can use
            <strong>course1.finalsScores[3]</strong> to
            return the value 68.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</p>
        <p>A function is a set of statements, which takes some input parameters, performs some actions using those
            parameters, and finally may return an output. Functions are useful when the same sub-task needs to
            be executed, but with different values for the input parameter.</p>
        <p>For instance, let's go back to our dessert made of ice cream, ganache and raspberries.
            You know the proportion of the ingredients to make 1 serving. If you want to scale up the recipe for
            multiple servings,
            you can write a function, which takes as input an object that contains the amount of ingredients for 1
            serving and the number of people.
        <p>

        <p><strong>function ingredientAmount(dessertObject, noOfPeople){/***do some calculations here ***/ return
                output;}</strong></p>
        <p><strong>var fancyDessert = {icecream : 30, ganache : 10, raspberries : 15}</strong></p>
        <p> If you have 4 guests for whom you are preparing this dessert, you can call the function and retrieve the
            calculated amounts in an output variable as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>var outputObject = ingredientAmount(fancyDessert,4)</strong></p>
        <p>If you want to make another dessert recipe, and this time for 10 people, you can simply call
            your function as follows to return the calculated amounts of ingredients you require:
        </p>
        <p><strong>var outputObject = ingredientAmount(anotherFancyDessert,10)</strong></p>
